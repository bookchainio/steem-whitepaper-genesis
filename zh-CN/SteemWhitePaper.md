<!-- toc -->

# 简介

总体而言，由用户生成的内容已经为像Reddit、Facebook和Twitter这样的社交媒体公司的股东们创造了价值数十亿美元的财富。 **在2014年，Reddit曾经做出假设：如果对每一个在reddit.com发表文章、评论和点赞的人公平的奖励Reddit公司的股份，那么其平台将会得到改进。[^1]**。 Steem旨在通过对提供优质贡献的人提供回报的方式来支持社交媒体和在线社区，同时通过这个过程产生一个可以流通在更广阔市场的货币，涵盖那些尚未接触过加密货币经济的群体。

在设计Steem的过程中，有一些关键的原则。 最重要的一个原则就是：对每一个对某项事业做出贡献的个人都应该收到该事业相应比例的所有权，报酬，或债务。 这个原则同样适用于所有初创公司，就像这些公司在创建及后期融资阶段会分配股份一样。

第二个原则就是所有形式的资产都同样有价值。 这意味着那些贡献了宝贵的时间和精力来生产并策划内容的人，和那些贡献了宝贵金钱的人同样有价值。 这就是汗水公平原则[^2]，也是之前的加密货币就有的概念，但对于超过几十个个体使用时经常会出现问题。

第三个原则就是社区生产的产品是要为社区成员服务。 这条原则的范例包括信用联盟、食品合作社和共享健康计划，它们服务社区成员，而不是将产品或服务卖给社区外的人员。

Steem社区向其成员提供以下服务：

1. 一个经策展过(curated)的新闻和评论的来源。
2. 一个能为个性化问题得到高质量答案的方法。
3. 一个和美元挂钩的稳定加密货币。
4. 免费支付。
5. 向其他成员提供如上服务的任务。

和之前的社交媒体及加密货币平台相比，Steem有目的通过经济上激励的方式具备了为每一个参与者提供了更加公平也更具包容性的结果的潜质。 本文将探讨现有的经济奖励方式，并展示Steem的奖励机制如何对大多数的参与者带来更好的结果。

## 认可贡献

Steem是一个为解决社交媒体经济的应用和货币化而设计的方案。 我们的观点是用于帮助主要社交媒体平台成长的技术同样可以用来创建一个成功的加密货币。 基于加密货币的经济奖励机制可以极大的促进新的社交媒体平台的发展。 我们相信加密货币和社交媒体网络的协同效应将会让Steem在市场上抢占先机。

Steem所面临的挑战就是要设计一个对每一个单独贡献进行评分的算法，该算法要被绝大多数社区成员认可为能够对每个贡献的主观价值进行公平评估。 在一个理想世界中，社区成员将会互相合作，对其他成员的贡献进行评分，并获取公平的报酬。 在现实世界中，必须设计算法来防止某些人故意操纵获利。 任何对评分系统的广泛滥用都会导致社区成员对经济体系的公平性失去信心。

现有的平台以每一用户一票的原则来运作。 这就创造了一个可以通过Sybil（假伪冒）攻击操纵排名的环境，服务供应商必须积极的识别和阻止舞弊者。 尽管仅有的回报是网络流量或网络审查，人们已经试图操纵Reddit、Facebook和Twitter的评分算法。

Steem平台上帐户的基本单位是STEEM，一种加密货币代币。 Steem的运行基础是一STEEM一票。 在这个模型下，根据帐户余额来计算，那些对平台贡献最大的个人对平台中的贡献如何评分有最大的影响。 此外，Steem只允许参与到多年行权计划的成员参与投票。 在这种模型下，成员拥有经济激励以实现STEEM长期价值最大化的方式来投票。

Steem是基于一个相对简单的概念来设计的：*每个人向社区提供的有意义的贡献应该在它所增加的价值上得到认可。*只有人们做出的有意义贡献被认可时，他们才会继续贡献，同时社区得以成长。 社区内部的给予和索取的不平衡是不可持续的。 最终给予者会对支持索取者感到厌倦从而脱离社区。

挑战在于建立一个能够识别什么是需要的贡献以及它们相对价值的系统，同时系统可以拓展以适用于无限多的人。

对贡献进行评估和奖励的一个有效系统是自由市场。 自由市场可以被看作是一个单一社区，每个人彼此进行交易，通过收益和损失来分配奖励。 市场体系奖励那些为别人创造价值的人，并惩罚那些消耗超过他们所创造价值的人。 自由市场支持多种不同货币，货币只是一种每个人都容易交换的商品。

由于自由市场是一种行之有效的体系，这就吸引人们创造一个自由市场体系，其中的内容消费者直接向内容生产者付费。 然而，对于内容的创造和策展(curation)，直接支付是低效，也是不可行的。 相对于进行付款伴随的认知、财富和机会成本，内容的价值极低，很少有读者选择付费。 大量的免费替代品意味着强制收费会把读者赶往其他地方。 曾经有过一些实行由读者向作者按文章小额付款的尝试，但都没有得到普及。

Steem的设计目的是通过改变经济方程式来实现对所有类型的贡献进行微额付款。 读者不再需要决定他们是否想要从自己口袋中向他人付款，而是对内容点赞或踩，Steem会根据他们的投票来决定每一个奖励。 这意味着人们面对一个熟悉并被广泛使用的界面，并且无需面对在传统微支付和小费平台中的认知、金融和机会成本等问题。

来自社区成员的投票对于Steem精确分配贡献者的奖励是至关重要的。 因此投票本身也是一个非常重要的贡献并且值得受到奖励。 一些平台，例如Slashdot，使用meta-moderation [^3]作为排名和奖励诚实评审者的一种方法。 Steem选择奖励那些对某项内容的宣传贡献最大的成员，并且对投票者的奖励和对内容创造者的最终奖励成正比。

还有一些其他形式的贡献也受到Steem的认可且通过客观指标评估并奖励。 这包括：交易验证、挖掘工作证明、流动性奖励和报告舞弊出块者。

# 贡献方式

本节概述了Steem背后的概念以及对那些向Steem社区提供有意义且可衡量的贡献的人进行的奖励。

## 资本投入

社区可以有两种方式来吸引资本：债务和所有权。 那些购买所有权的人会在社区成长时获利，但在社区收缩时受损。 那些购买债务的人会有保障的得到一定的利息，但不会从社区的发展获利。 这两种类型的资本贡献对社区的成长和货币的价值都是宝贵的。 此外，持有所有权有两种方式：流动性资产和股权。 股权是一个长期的承诺，不能在短期内出售。

Steem网络将这些不同的资产类别叫做Steem (STEEM)、Steem Power (SP) 和Steem Dollars (SMD)。

## Steem (STEEM)

Steem是Steem区块链上账户的基础单位。 所有其他代币都是从STEEM的价值派生出来。 一般意义来说，只有在需要流动性代币时，才需要在短期内持有STEEM。 如果有人想要进入或离开Steem平台，他们就需要购买或出售STEEM。 一旦STEEM被购买，它就应该被转换为SP或SMD，以消除长期稀释效果的影响。

由于非SMD的刺激，STEEM每年增发100%。 对于那些持有STEEM而没有转换为SP的人，他们持有的STEEM每天会被稀释约0.19%。 虽然这个比例看起来有些高，然而针对少于10天的交易，它仍然比信用卡手续费要便宜。 此外，每日的代币的生成和价格每日波动相比是微不足道的。

购买比特币或其他加密货币的人在10天后售出，由于价格波动，他们很容易损失3%甚至更多。 购买比特币并在同一天售出的人通常要支付超过0.4%的市场费用。 换句话说，对于典型的个人持有STEEM期间，STEEM的通货膨胀率是微不足道的。

大多数的通货膨胀是由会计因素所致，而非真正的财富再分配。 90%的非SMD通货膨胀被分配给现有STEEM的持有者，与他们持有SP余额成正比，使得通胀更是一种“分裂”。 只有10%的非SMD通货膨胀会重新分配给网络的所有者。

## Steem Power (SP)

初创公司需要长期的资本承诺。 那些给初创公司投资的人要等上几年后才能出售手中的股票获利。 如果没有长期资本承诺，初创公司通过增发股权寻求更多的资本，这与希望退出的现有股东产生矛盾。 精明的投资者希望它们贡献的资本能够使公司成长，但如果新资本给了那些想要退出的股东，公司就不可能成长。

拥有长期承诺非常重要，因为只有这样社区才能做出长期规划。 投资者的长期承诺也会导致他们投票支持社区的长期增长，而非短期的泵式增长。

在加密货币圈子里，投机者会在不同的加密货币间进行选择，主要取决于哪一种加密货币会有短期增长。 Steem想要建立一个主要由具备长远眼光的人们所拥有和控制的社区。

由于Steem想要鼓励长期增长，Steem每创建 1 个STEEM，它就会向Steem Power (SP) 的持有者分配 9 个STEEM，通过贡献激励机制实现资金增长。 久而久之，这就会导致整体STEEM POWER对应的STEEM价值和STEEM总量的比例是9:1。 (非常有可能的一种情况就是，由于新发行的STEEM的持续增长，实际比例会比 9:1要高。) 这同时也意味着长期持有者几乎会完全受到保护，而不受到资金增长而导致的稀释效应的影响。

SP只能在两年的时间里均分为104周，每周固定数额的方式转换回STEEM。 '1 SP'可以被理解为STEEM池中的一个股份。 网络会在每一个块中自动增加STEEM到池中。 在任何时候用户可以按照池中STEEM和SP总量的比例，把STEEM转换为SP。 将STEEM转换成SP并不会稀释SP持有人的股份。 类似的，每次SP转回STEEM的时候都按照当前的比例进行。 个人得到的保证就是，在将来会有比他们初期把STEEM转换为SP时更多的STEEM。

除非通过自动分批转换请求，SP余额不能进行转让，也不可进行分割。这意味着SP不容易在加密货币交易所进行交易。

SP是对内容投票或者反对的先决条件。这意味着在Steem平台上，SP是一种能够赋予持有者专有权力的访问令牌。

从STEEM转换为SP被称作为powering up，而从SP转换为Steem被称作为 powering down。 例如，成员可以在两年时间内逐步power down，但却可以立刻power up。

## Steem Dollars (SMD)

稳定性是全球经济成功的一个重要标志。 没有稳定性，世界各地的人们都不可能在从事商业活动和储蓄时享有低的认知成本。 由于稳定性是成功经济的重要特征，Steem Dollars的设计宗旨就在于将稳定性带给加密货币世界以及使用Steem网络的每一个人。

Steem Dollars使用和可兑换货币类似的机制创建，这种机制通常被用于给初创公司提供资金。 在初创公司的圈子里，可兑换货币是一种短期的债券工具，在后续的融资环节中可以按比例转换为公司的所有权。 一个基于区块链的代币可以被看作是社区的所有权，而可兑换货币则可以被看作以其他物品或货币标定的债务。 可兑换货币的条款允许持有者可以在很短的通知时限内以公平市场价格转换为基础代币。 创建可转换的货币使得区块链网络在为代币持有者获取利益最大化的同时得以成长。

人们通常用Steem Dollars的缩写符号 SMD 来引用它。 创建SMD需要几个综合因素：可靠的喂价、防止舞弊的规则、和货币流动性。 提供可靠的喂价需要三个因素：最小化错误喂价的影响、最大化产生错误喂价的成本以及最小化时限的重要性。

### 最小化舞弊性喂价

SP持有者通过投票选出喂价的发布者，由他们发布喂价。 那些通过高质量喂价获利的人信任这些被选出的喂价发布者。 通过支付被选中的喂价发布者，Steem创建了市场竞争环境，让参与者竞争喂价的资格。 喂价的发布者获得的报酬越多，他们发布虚假信息的代价就越大。

对于给定的一组受信任且当选的喂价发布者，实际的转换价格可以通过喂价的中间值衍生出来。 通过这种方式，如果任何的喂价发布者产生异常，他们就会对中间值有着最小的影响，同时还会影响他们的声誉。

即使所有的喂价发布者都是诚实的，仍旧存在这种可能，就是大多数的喂价发布者会被无法控制的事件所影响。 Steem网络被设计为可以容忍短期内喂价中间值的错误，在此期间社区会积极的解决问题。 一个可能需要一些时间来修正的例子就是，短期的市场操纵。 进行长时间的市场操纵是很难并且代价是非常昂贵的。 另外一个例子就是中心化的交易所出错，或者交易所发布的数据损坏。

Steem使用一周内价格的中间值来抵消价格波动。发表的喂价中间值每小时取样一次。

只要喂价的损坏持续时间不超过取中间值区间的一半，就会对转换价格的影响降到最低。 在喂价被破坏时，网络的参与者就有机会在错误喂价对实际转换价格影响前，通过投票否决那些错误喂价发布者。 或许更重要的是，在喂价开始影响转换价格之前，它给予喂价发布者一个机会去检测并修正喂价。

在一周之内，社区成员有三天半的时间来应对发生的任何问题。

### 缓解计时攻击

市场参与者获取信息的速度要快于区块链中一周内的转换价格的中值。 这个信息可以被交易者所用而获利，当然，是以牺牲社区利益为代价的。 如果STEEM突然涨价，交易者可以在极低风险下请求把他们的SMD按照旧的较低价格转换为STEEM，然后再以新的较高的价格卖出STEEM。

Steem通过将所有转换请求延迟一周的方式来平衡这种操作。 这意味着在真正进行转换的时候，不论交易者还是区块链在信息上面都没有任何优势。

### 最小化转换时的舞弊

如果人们可以双向进行自由转换，交易者可以充分利用区块链的转换率，在不改变价格的情况下进行大额交易。 交易者在看到价格大幅上涨的时候可以以高价（在风险最高的时候）换成SMD，并在价格回调时换回来。 Steem协议通过只允许人们从SMD转换为STEEM，而不能反向转换，来保护社区免受这种舞弊的影响。

区块链决定如何、何时来创建SMD，以及谁会得到它。这会保持创建SMD的稳定速度并消除大多数的舞弊。

### 货币流动性

SMD可以在指定的时间内按照公平的价格被转换为STEEM的等值美元，但这并不意味着它可以被看作是可靠的美元替代品。 这些资产需要市场的流动性，在STEEM和SMD之间进行自由转换。 区块链被迫采取评测措施，以防止舞弊造成的可兑换代币的质量下降。 为了弥补这种质量上的损失，区块链可以为货币流动性提供者提供固定的成本奖励。 虽然市场操纵和舞弊造成的损失可能是没有上限的，鼓励提现的成本是固定的。

提现供应商购买和出售SMD和STEEM。 他们承担了主要的短期价格风险和长期喂价风险，给其余市场参与者提供一个高质量，高流动性的市场以从中交易。

Steem有一个构建于区块链上的SMD和STEEM上的市场。 用户可以通过向市场双方提供流动性来获取回报。 区块链使用一个简单的算法来对用户的流动性资金供应和消费进行评级。

一个用户一旦挂单且至少一分钟并被填单，则被看作是流动性的供应者。 如果在填单之前用户取消订单，则用户不会被记录为流动性供应者。

用户必须在市场双方持续的提供流动性以获得奖励。评分算法如下：

      流动性点数 = 净报价量 x 净询价量
    

每小时具备最大流动性点数的用户会收到1200 STEEM，同时他的流动性点数被清零。 在一周内不能赚取任何流动性点数账户的流动性点数也会被清零。 这意味着无论你提供大额的货币流动性或者长期提供小额的货币流动性，你都会获得一定比例的奖励金额。 如果净报价量或净询价量两者之一为负，则流动性点数被视为0。

### 可持续债务与所有权比率

如果一个代币可被看作是整个代币供应中的所有权的话，则可转换代币的美元可被视为债务。 一旦债务对所有权比例过高，则整个货币会变得不稳定。 债务转换可以大幅提升代币供应，反过来一旦出售则会在市场上压低价格。 随后的转换要求发行更多的代币。 如果不加控制，系统会崩溃并留下毫无价值的所有权和如山的债务。 债务和所有权的比例过高会导致投资者不愿投资。

Steem每生成一个SMD，会同时生成价值$19.00的STEEM并被转换为SP。 这意味着在一个稳定的市场中，债务和所有权的最高比例为1:19，或者大约5%。 一旦Steem的价值下降了50%，则这个比例会上升到10%。 一旦STEEM的价值下降了88%，则债务和所有权的比率会达到40%。 假定最终的STEEM价值会稳定下来，则债务和所有权的比例会自然回落到5%。

保持保守的5%债务/所有权比例背后的原因是，即使所有债务都被转换并出售，仍然应该有足够的购买者，使得对代币持有者手中代币的有效稀释程度仍能保持相对较小。

STEEM代币价值如果出现快速波动，则会明显的影响债务/所有权比例。 对于STEEM创建比例的下限，其计算依据是包括所有未付的SMD和SP对应的STEEM价值（由当前汇率和喂价决定）。

### 利息

SMD向其持有人支付利息。 利率由发布喂价的人来设定，因此它能自动适应不断变化的市场行情。 所有债务都会给贷方带来风险。 对于人们持有每一个SMD而未兑换的，他们实际上是在向社区放贷一美元。 他们相信在未来的某个时刻，会有人愿意以一个美金从他们手中购买一个SMD，或者有投资者或投机者愿意购买他们用SMD转换成的STEEM。

当社区成员愿意持有SMD时，STEEM和SP持有者将会获得一个杠杆。 这个杠杆放大了社区成长所带来的收益，同时反过来也促进社区的成长。 一旦价格下跌，STEEM持有者会因放大的稀释作用而遭受损失。 一些加密货币项目展示了一个规律，增加愿意信任网络并投资的用户群所为网络增加的价值，会高于在市场低迷期时稀释效应所造成的负面结果。

### 设置喂价

精明的读者都会想到，受限供应的有息资产可能会造成标定资产价值的波动，这取决于针对同一资产，是否有赚取利息的其他机会。 由于能够在绑定美元的资产(SMD)上获得高利率，很多人会对有限供应的Steem Dollars竞价，从而导致其价格上升，直到它们的价值不再是1美元。 在经济学中有一个原理，叫做三元悖论[^4]，它阐述了不可能在同一时间同时满足以下三个条件：

1. 稳定的汇率
2. 资本自由移动
3. 独立货币政策

如果Steem喂价者的目标是创建一个独立的货币政策，允许他们在创造和销毁Steem Dollars的同时可以完全控制利率，他们将会遇到问题。 三元悖论原理中阐述了Steem Dollars要么就要限制资本流动，导致对美元汇率不稳定，要么对利率的控制就会非常有限。

Steem喂价者面临的最主要问题就是，将SMD和美元 (USD)之间的汇率保持在一比一。 在任何时候一旦SMD持续以超过1.00美元的汇率交易，必须停止支付利息。 如果在债务利息率为 0% 但仍需溢价的一个市场中，可以肯定的说，市场希望能够扩大信贷，其额度超过社区愿意承担的债务。 在这种情况下，SMD将会被估值超过 1.00 美元，在不收取负利率的情况下，社区难有作为。

如果债务对所有权的比率低于10%，且SMD以低于1美元的价格交易，则应增加利率。这会鼓励更多的人持有他们手中的SMD并支撑价格。

如果SMD以低于1美元的价格交易，且债务对所有权比率超过10%，则喂价应被上调，也就是每一个SMD应能换取更多的STEEM。 这会增加对SMD的需求，同时会降低债务对所有权的比率，使得SMD价格和美元持平。

假设STEEM的价值增长速度超过Steem网络创建SMD的速度，债务和所有权的比率应该保持在目标利率之下，这样的利息将会惠及所有人。 如果网络的价值持平或者下落，则任何的利率都会使得债务和所有权的比率更差。

实际上，这些受社区信任的喂价者具有设定货币政策的责任，以保持和美元的稳定汇率。 滥用这种权力会损害STEEM的价值，因此SP的持有者会明智的投票给那些能够根据以上原则调整喂价和利率的见证人。

如果债务对所有权的比率达到危险的高度，市场参与者会选择避免兑换请求，这样喂价就会被调整，从而增加在转换SMD时支付STEEM的比率。

对利率政策的调整，和/或STEEM/SBD转换汇率的溢价/折价，都应该是对长期平均偏差的缓慢且受控的回应，而不是试图对短期市场条件做出的反应。 由于那些资金流动性的提供者能够吸收短期的市场需求，因此区块链会给予他们奖励。

我们相信这些规则会给市场参与者信心，让他们相信持有以1.00美金的价格购买的SMD不会赔钱。 我们可以充分预期，在正常市场条件下，SMD会在介于0.99美元和1.01美元之间的一个很窄区间内交易。

## 积极贡献

积极的工作量证明展示了另外的一种分配货币的方法，以改进完全*客观*的工作量证明系统（例如挖矿）。 实现了*积极*工作量证明的应用应该比实现*客观*工作量证明的系统范围要宽泛的多，因为前者可以围绕一个有充分定义的概念而构建一个社区。 当人们加入一个社区时，他们其实是在购入一组特定的信念，并用投票的方式来强化社区的价值和目标。

实际上，评估工作的标准完全是主观的，它的定义完全在源代码之外。 一个社区可能希望奖励艺术家，另一个社区可能希望奖励诗人，第三个社区则有可能希望奖励喜剧演员。 其他社区可能会选择奖励慈善事业，或者帮助推进政治议程。

每种货币能达到的价值取决于在一个特定社区内对影响力的需求，以及市场对社区规模的预期。 与以前的系统不同，积极的工作量证明使得社区能够对其认为有价值的事物进行资助，并对之前非货币化的事物货币化。

### 分发货币

有两种方式可以让人们参与到加密货币社区：他们可以*购入*，或者*完成工作*。 在这两种情况下，用户为货币增加价值。然而，相比于*闲置资金*，绝大多数人拥有更多的*空余时间*。 可以设想在一个没有*资金*，但有大量*时间*的贫穷的社区中来推广一种货币。 如果人们可以通过为彼此工作而获取金钱，他们将通过一种公平的记账/货币体系，来实现价值。

将一种货币以普遍认可的公平方式分发给尽可能多的人是一项具有挑战性的任务。 那些可以完全由一个客观的计算机算法来进行评估的任务自然是有限的，同时普遍而言，它们对外界的正面效应也非常有限。 以比特币类型的挖矿为例，这会导致专有的硬件产品，同时会引导人们花时间开发更有效的算法。 这些工作甚至会帮助找到新的质数，但这些工作对社区来说毫无意义，或者对范围更广的货币持有者社区毫无意义。 更重要的是，规模经济和市场导向将会导致，在这种货币分配中，将除去专家外的所有人都排除在外。 最终结果就是，基于算力的挖矿只是另一种形式的*购买*，原因在于它要求支付电费，或者能够胜任挖矿工作硬件的开发。

为了给所有人一个平等的机会来参与并赚取货币，需要给人们一个工作机会。 挑战在于如何能够判定人们的工作量及工作的相对质量，并以此为依据来有效的给百万计的用户分配奖励。 这就需要引入一个灵活的投票机制。 尤其要注意的是，这要求管理机构能够以尽可能分散和去中心化的方式来分配资金。

对百万计的用户进行奖励的第一步就是，无论工作量如何以及用户如何投票，保证以分布的方式定额分配货币。 这就将问题由*"我们是否该付钱?"*转换为*“我们应该向谁付钱？”*，同时向市场传递一个信号，资金正在被分配，并流向那些把*工作*判给叫价最高的人。 这和比特币保证奖励那些首先发现最难哈希值的人50 BTC一样。 就像比特币一样，所有工作都应该在支付之前完成，并且对未来工作的承诺不做任何支付。

下一步是对那些稍微做了点正面事的人有*某些*奖励。 这可以通过对所有已完成的工作进行评估，并以此为依据来按比例分配奖励。 市场竞争越激烈，就越难（更高的质量和更大工作量）赚取同样的报酬。

### 针对货币分配的投票

假定有固定数额的资金需要进行分配，同时假定只有那些对长期投资及货币效用感兴趣的人来决定如何进行分配。 每一个投资的用户投票给那些最出色完成工作的人，这样在每天结束的时候，当日可用的资金就会按照投票的比例来进行分配，即使只是获得一个净投票的人也能有所收获。

单纯的投票流程设计会导致一个所谓的“囚徒困境”，也就是说每个人都有动机给自己投票，而这和整个社区的发展目标背道而驰。 如果每一个投票者都陷入此瑕疵而给自己投票，这样就没有货币会被分发，这种货币就无法获得期待的网络效应。 另一方面，如果只有一个投票者给自己投票，这样该投票者就会获得不该得的收益，但对整个货币的价值影响最小。

为了重新调整激励机制，同时不鼓励人们给自己投票，资金必须以一种非线性的方式来进行分配。 例如在投票中使用一个二次函数，这样的话，获得比別人多两倍投票的用戶应该获取四倍收益，获得比別人多三倍投票的用戶应该获取九倍收益。 换句话说，奖励的比例是\\(投票数^{2}\\) ，而不是*投票数*。 根据梅特卡夫定律[^5]，这就能真实映射出与参与人数\\(n^{2}\\) 对应的网络效应值。

假定所有用户持有同等股份，那些只能收到自己投票用户的收益会远远少于那些能够收到100个不用用户投票的人。 这就会鼓励用户*彼此合作*来对同样的工作投票以获得收益最大化。 在多人对同一工作*合谋*投票的时候，系统还提供一个财务激励机制，将奖励在他们之间平分。

#### 合谋投票

虽然系统期待的目标是鼓励合作以对最佳的工作分配奖励，但破坏这一目标的*合谋*应被尽量减少。 共有两种的*合谋*，最简单的一种方式就是，一个用户比其他用户购入了更多股份，另一种方式则是涉及很多持有小股份用户之间的合作。 大股东的投票影响力可能会是小股东的100甚至1000倍，这意味着相较于奖励的线性分配，大股东们更有动机会不自律的给自己投票。

无论一个人拥有多少资金，总会有其他的人会拥有和他类似的财富。 就算最富有的人拥有的财富也很少有可能会超过紧随其后的两到三人的财富总和。 此外，那些在一个社区中投入大笔资金的人如果尝试给自己投票，他们的损失也会最大。 着就像一个公司的CEO决定停止发放工资，这样他就可以独享所有利润。 结果就是，所有人都会选择辞职到其他公司去工作，导致公司没有任何价值，从而使得CEO破产而不是变得富有。

幸运的是，那些获得大量集中投票的工作亦会收到最严格的(公开) 审查。 通过追加的*负投票*，众多的小股东也能抵消那些利益集团或不自律的大股东们的投票力。 此外，一旦由于滥用投票权而导致币价大跌，相比给自己投票的获益，大股东会损失更多。 事实上，对于诚实的大股东们，更有效的方式是，制定政策限制滥用，同时相较于给小的贡献投票，使用负投票。

对*负投票*的使用可以防止人们滥用系统，从而解决很多人都有的*螃蟹心态*，其实就是损人利己。 螃蟹心态通常是指那些目光短浅的人会让好人们失望，同时也指好人让坏人们失望。 螃蟹心态的唯一问题就是人们*错误的相信*，人们是以损坏他人利益为基础而获利的。

> #### 螃蟹桶的故事[^6]
> 
> 一个男人正在海滩散步，看到另一个男人正在海浪边钓鱼，他旁边放了一个鱼饵桶。当他靠近后，看到鱼饵桶中有一些活螃蟹，却没有盖子。
> 
> “为什么你不把鱼饵桶盖上，这样螃蟹就不会逃走？”，他问到。
> 
> “你不明白。”，钓鱼的男人说。“如果在桶中只有一只螃蟹，毫无疑问它会很快从桶中逃出来。” 然而，当桶中有很多只螃蟹的时候，如果某只螃蟹试图沿着桶边往上爬，其他的螃蟹会抓住它并把它拖回去，因此试图逃离的螃蟹将会和其他螃蟹分享共同的命运。
> 
> 人也是这样的。 如果某人试图做不一样的事情，获得更好的成绩，提高自己，逃离现有的环境，或者追寻更大的梦想，其他人会试图把她拖回去以分享相同的命运。

消除“滥用”是不可能的，因此也不应该成为目标。 就算那些试图“滥用”系统的人同时也在完成他们的工作。 他们通过成功的滥用系统或合谋而获得的任何利益，类似于传统的比特币挖矿，或矿池方式的合谋挖矿，至少对于货币的分发是有价值的。 不过必须要做的就是要确保滥用不要太过猖獗，以至于它会影响那些做真正支持社区及其货币的人的积极性。

创建一个社区货币的目标就是使得更多的“螃蟹在桶中”。 采用非常极端的方式来消除所有的滥用就像在螃蟹桶上盖上盖子，虽然能够防止个别螃蟹逃走，但却是以增加让新螃蟹进入桶中的难度为代价的。 其实，只要使得墙壁变滑，并给予螃蟹足够的权力来防止其他螃蟹逃脱就足够了。

### 限定频率的投票

最小化滥用的一个最重要部分就是对投票频率的限定。 每个用户每天只能阅读并评估一定量的工作。 任何尝试过于频繁的投票往往就是一个自动化和潜在滥用的信号。 通过投票频率的限定，频繁投票持股人的每一个投票的影响力要低于那些相对投票较少的持股人。 试图将代币在多个账户间分割同时也会将投票的影响力进行分割，因此不会增加其净影响力，也不会跳过投票频率的限定。

![](\img_voting_rate_limiting.png)

上面的图表展示了一个用户的投票能量如何在其投票后减少，以及伴随着未投票时间的流逝如何恢复投票能量。 这些图表使用的是名义上的时间，同时可以被扩展到任何目标投票频率。 需要注意的是，投票能量会在连续投票时快速下降，然后缓慢的恢复。

投票能量乘以用户投资的代币，可被用来决定在奖励池中的多少份额会被分配给指定的工作。

### 延迟支付

![](\img_change_voting_period_eg.png)

为了进一步的防止滥用，所有的支付都会延迟一段时间，从投票开始后24个小时的股份加权平均值。 This ensures that large stakeholders cannot snipe payouts by voting at the last second before other voters (aka crabs) have a chance to negate the potential abuse. Once a payout is made to the user all votes are reset to 0. If votes come in after the payout then the process begins again.

This chart shows how the voting period expiration changes in response to new positive and negative votes being applied. New votes extend the payout period in proportion to how large they are relative to all votes that have gone before. Around time 40 a large number of new votes were added which extended the voting period by 12 hours, subsequent smaller votes had far less impact on the voting period.

### Payout Distribution

![](\img_the_new_marketplace.png)

One of the primary goals of Steem's reward system is to produce the best discussions on the internet. Each and every year 10% of the market capitalization of Steem is distributed to users submitting, voting on, and discussing content. At the size of Bitcoin this could be as much as $1.75 million dollars per day being given to top contributors.

The actual distribution will depend upon the voting patterns of users, but we suspect that the vast majority of the rewards will be distributed to the most popular content. Steem weighs payouts proportional to \\(n^{2}\\) the amount of Steem Power voting for a post. In other words, post x would receive a payout proportional to:

\\(votes[x]^{2} / sum(votes[0...n]^{2})\\)

Zipf's Law[^7] is one of those empirical rules that characterize a surprising range of real-world phenomena remarkably well. It says that if we order some large collection by size or popularity, the second element in the collection will be about half the measure of the first one, the third one will be about one-third the measure of the first one, and so on. In general, the \\(k^{th}\\)-ranked item will measure about 1/k of the first one.

Taking popularity as a rough measure of value, then the value of each individual item is given by Zipf's Law. That is, if we have a million items, then the most popular 100 will contribute a third of the total value, the next 10,000 another third, and the remaining 989,900 the final third. The value of the collection of n items is proportional to log(n).

The impact of this voting and payout distribution is to offer large bounties for good content while still rewarding smaller players for their long-tail contribution.

The economic effect of this is similar to a lottery where people over-estimate their probability of getting votes and thus do more work than the expected value of their reward and thereby maximize the total amount of work performed in service of the community. The fact that everyone "wins something" plays on the same psychology that casinos use to keep people gambling. In other words, small rewards help reinforce the idea that it is possible to earn bigger rewards.

#### Rewarding Parent Posts

Good discussion requires back and forth posting. When you reply to someone else, they get 50% of any payout you receive in that thread. This rule applies up to 6 levels deep. Starting a big discussion greatly rewards the parent poster.

Failure to properly nest your posts in the discussion is a good way to get down voted.

This incentive structure motivates people to contribute in a way that motivates others to get involved. It encourages people to ask good questions so that others can provide valuable answers.

### Payouts

When a post receives a payout it takes the form of 50% SMD and 50% SP. The Steem Power give the user increased voting and transaction power while the SMD gives the user an immediate benefit in a stable currency. As we've already discussed at length, both SP and SMD are designed to encourage long-term holding rather than short-term selling.

# Consensus Algorithm

Consensus is the process by which a community comes to a universally recognized, unambiguous agreement on piece of information. There are many algorithms society has developed for reaching consensus about who owns what. Every government on earth is a primitive consensus algorithm whereby the population agrees to abide by a certain set of rules enshrined in a constitution. Governments establish courts, judges, and juries to interpret the subjective facts and render a final decision. Most of the time people abide by the decision even if it was wrong.

The algorithms used by cryptocurrencies provide a better way to reach consensus. Cryptographically signed testimony from individuals is recorded in a public ledger that establishes the absolute global order of events. A deterministic computer algorithm can then process this ledger to derive a universally accepted conclusion. So long as the members of a community agree on the processing algorithm, the result of the algorithm is authoritative.

The primary consideration is determining what testimony is allowed to enter the public record. Systems should be designed to minimize the potential for censorship. Censorship on the public ledger is similar to preventing someone from voting in an election. In both cases an individual is prevented from impacting the global consensus.

## Consensus in Steem

Conceptually, the consensus algorithm adopted by Steem is similar to the consensus algorithm adopted by companies throughout the world. People with a vested interest in the future value of Steem vote to select individuals responsible for including testimony in the public record. Voting is weighted proportional to each individual's vested interest.

In the world of cryptocurrencies, the public record is commonly referred to as a *blockchain*. A *block* is a group of signed transactions.

With Steem, block production is done in rounds. Each round 21 witnesses are selected to create and sign blocks of transactions. Nineteen (19) of these witnesses are selected by approval voting, one is selected by a computational proof-of-work, and one is timeshared by every witness that didn't make it into the top 19 proportional to their total votes. The 21 active witnesses are shuffled every round to prevent any one witness from constantly ignoring blocks produced by the same witness placed before.

This process is designed to provide the best reliability while ensuring that everyone has the potential to participate in block production regardless of whether they are popular enough to get voted to the top. People have three options to overcome censorship by the top 19 elected witnesses: patiently wait in line with everyone else not in the top 19, purchase enough computational power to solve a proof of work faster than others, or purchase more SP to improve voting power. Generally speaking, applying censorship is a good way for elected witnesses to lose their job and therefore, it is unlikely to be a real problem on the Steem network.

Because the active witnesses are known in advance, Steem is able to schedule witnesses to produce blocks every 3 seconds. Witnesses synchronize their block production via the NTP protocol. A variation of this algorithm has been in use by the BitShares network for over a year where it has been proven to be reliable.

## Mining in Steem

Traditional proof of work blockchains combine block production with the solving of a proof of work. Because the process of solving a proof of work takes an unpredictable amount of time, the result is unpredictable block production times. Steem aims to have consistent and reliable block production every 3 seconds with almost no potential for forks.

To achieve this Steem separates block production from solving of proof of work. When a miner solves a proof of work for Steem, they broadcast a transaction containing the work. The next scheduled witness includes the transaction into the blockchain. When the transaction is included the miner is added to the queue of miners scheduled to produce blocks. Each round one miner is popped from the queue and included in the active set of witnesses. The miner gets paid when they produce a block at the time they are scheduled.

The difficulty of the proof of work doubles every time the queue length grows by 4. Because one miner is popped from the queue every round, and each round takes 21 \* 3 = 63 seconds, the difficulty automatically halves if no proof of work is found in no more than 21 \* 3 \* 4 = 252 seconds.

### Mining Rewards require Steem Power

After the first month, Steem miners are paid in Steem Power (SP). SP is liquidated through the two-year process of "powering down". This means that miners must wait for a long time, likely many months, before sufficient mining rewards have been powered down to allow them to recover the cost of electricity and computational resources. The powering down process discourages creation of mining pools because the pool operator would have to spread payouts over years.

The effect of paying mining rewards in SP is to prevent miners from using today's price to determine the pro tability of mining. Few people will agree on what the future price will be. This means mining difficulty will be driven by those who place the highest estimate on future value. Miners without a long-term interest in the platform will be discouraged from competing. Ultimately this means that the proceeds of mining are less likely to be dumped on the market because they will accrue to long-term believers in the platform.

### Mining Algorithm

The mining algorithm adopted by Steem requires the miner to have access to the private key of the account that will receive the rewards. This requirement has several important consequences. First it encourages optimization of elliptic curve signature verification algorithms needed by Steem. Second it makes it challenging to set up mining pools because the pool operator would have to share control over the reward with all of the "anonymous" miners. Third, it makes it difficult to use botnets because the botnet operator would have to distribute their private key to all compromised machines.

The following pseudocode describes how the proof-of-work hash value is calculated:

    Let H    = Head Block ID
    Let H2   = SHA256(H + NONCE)
    Let PRI  = Producer Private Key
    Let PUB  = Producer Public Key
    Let S    = SIGN(PRI, SHA256(H))
    Let K    = RECOVER_PUBLIC_KEY(H2, S)
    Let POW  = SHA256(K)
    

### Botnet Resistant

Many proof of work coins end up being mined by botnets. A botnet is a collection of thousands or millions of machines that have been compromised by hackers. These hackers steal the computational and electrical resources of compromised machines to mine cryptocurrency tokens.

Steem has many properties that prevent these computational thieves from profiting. Botnet operators are profit seeking enterprises and typically sell their stolen resources to the highest bidder. This means that those who utilize a botnet pay for the computational power in the same way that someone who uses Amazon EC2 does. The vesting requirement of Steem means that the capital spent on buying the resources of the botnet will be tied up for a long period of time during which the operator is exposed to price volatility.

Another way that botnet operators are prevented from profiting is the requirement to distribute the private key to all compromised machines. If even one compromised computer is discovered, the operator could lose their coins.

The last mitigation is the dependency on latency. Most botnets are comprised of computers with poor internet connections, these slow Internet connections will dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the computational resource.

It should be more profitable and less risky for botnet operators to use their resources for other activities than mining STEEM.

### Mining Pool Resistant

Miners have a total of 3 seconds to receive a block, solve the proof of work, and get the transaction to the next block producer. Much of this time will consist of network latency which means that it is critical for miners to be well connected to the network to make the most effective use of their computational resources.

Because of the constantly changing head block and network latency, forwarding a template for mining a specific block to participants of a mining pool adds additional network latency and reduces efficiency of pooled mining significantly.

# Eliminating Transaction Fees

Steem goes to great lengths to reward people for contributing to the network. It would be counterproductive to turn around and charge people every time they attempt to interact with the community.

Blockchain technology currently depends upon transaction fees to prevent spam. These fees suffer all of the known problems with microtransactions and prevent blockchains from being used for low-value transactions. Truly decentralized applications must offer users the appearance of free transactions if they wish to compete with their centralized alternatives. This paper outlines the approach used by Steem to eliminate the need for fees and thereby enable a wide range of previously untenable decentralized applications.

## The Problem With Fees

Blockchains are decentralized networks where all transactions are broadcast to all peers. Every so often a block is produced that includes some or all of the pending transactions. All blockchains must find a solution to prevent malicious users from consuming all of the available network capacity with worthless transactions. These worthless transactions can prevent other valuable transactions from being processed and ultimately destroy the network.

The solution adopted by most blockchains thus far is to charge a minimum transaction fee. A fee worth just a few cents is enough to make attacking the network expensive and unprofitable. While this approach solves the spam problem, it introduces new problems. Imagine solving the email spam problem by introducing a small fee on every email; people wouldn't use email.

### Micropayments Don't Work

The fundamental problem with charging transaction fees is that micropayments don't work, especially for low-value user actions. When a fee is charged on every transaction, it limits the types of transactions that a decentralized network can process. Regardless of how rational the argument for the necessity of fees, users still hate the experience of being nickeled and dimed for everything that they do.

Imagine if the websites we use every day charged us a fee every time we modify our accounts by changing the password. Users expect certain things to be free. Requiring users to make a decision on whether or not an action is worth a small fee creates anxiety that causes users to leave.

> A transaction can't be worth so much as to require a decision but worth so little that that decision is automatic. There is a certain amount of anxiety involved in any decision to buy, no matter how small, and it derives not from the interface used or the time required, but from the very act of deciding.  
> Micropayments, like all payments, require a comparison: "Is this much of X worth that much of Y?" There is a minimum mental transaction cost created by this fact that cannot be optimized away, because the only transaction a user will be willing to approve with no thought will be one that costs them nothing, which is no transaction at all.
> 
> *- Clay Shirky[^8]*

In the world of financial payments, small fees are acceptable because the value of the transaction is extremely high relative to the fee charged, and the buyer has already made a decision to buy. The world of potential blockchain applications is far greater than just financial payments and includes many necessary transactions for which fees are simply unacceptable to users.

Systems like BitShares, Nxt, Ripple, Counter Party and Stellar all allow users to place limit orders on the blockchain and all of them charge users a small fee to perform this action. Later if the user wishes to cancel their order, another fee is charged. Systems like Ethereum take micropayments to a whole new level: charging per calculation. All of these systems struggle to attract new mainstream users for the same reasons that a decentralized search engine would struggle to attract users from Google if it charged a small fee for every search. It doesn't matter how good the service is, people expect certain things to be free. This is true even if a user ends up paying more overall under a different fee structure.

### Fees are a Barrier to Entry

Any fee creates a barrier to entry for new users. Before someone can experiment with Ethereum they must acquire some ETH tokens. Anyone wanting to build a decentralized application on Ethereum must pass on the cost to their customers. Buying a crypto currency is not an easy task and rarely makes sense for amounts less than $10. This means that new users wanting to try out a new decentralized application must first be convinced to part with $10.

### Changing Fees

Over time a network must adjust fees. This can happen either due to an increase in the value of the token or due to a surge in capacity. Users like predictable fees and guaranteed service. While it is possible to dynamically adjust fees during times of heavy use, the result is a poor user experience.

### Sybil Attacks

Centralized websites prevent spam through rate limiting and some form of ID verification. Even something as simple as reCAPTCHA [^9] is sufficient to limit the creation of fake accounts. If someone abuses their account then centralized websites are free to block the account.

In a decentralized system there is no direct way to ban users nor centralized provider able to host a reCAPTCHA and enforce rate limiting of accounts. In fact, the inability to censor users is one of the main selling points of blockchain technology.

### Full Reserve vs Fractional Reserve

Let's view a blockchain like an Internet Service Provider (ISP) co-op which owns all of the cables in the town and has a maximum amount of bandwidth that it can provide at any time. People living in the town can buy shares in the ISP and in exchange they are entitled to utilize a portion of the available bandwidth.

The ISP has two choices, run a "full reserve" or "fractional reserve" system. Under a full reserve system each user is only allowed a fraction of the maximum bandwidth proportional to her shares. Because not everyone uses the Internet at the same time, the town's network would be significantly underutilized.

Under a fractional reserve system the individual users could utilize more bandwidth than they are entitled to at any given point in time so long as not everyone uses the Internet at the same time. The problem with operating a fractional reserve is that congestion occurs anytime too many people wish to use the network at the same time. The ISP needs a way to prioritize bandwidth during congested periods. In the most extreme case, a fully congested network must revert to a full reserve system. The challenge is setting the proper fractional reserve ratio.

## Bandwidth Instead of Micropayment Channels

The solution to the problems with micropayments is in implementing *dynamic fractional reserves*. Under this model the blockchain will automatically adjust the reserve ratio for the network during times of congestion. The blockchain will set a target utilization that leaves enough headroom for short term surges in demand. Any time the surges are sustained the blockchain reduces the maximum bandwidth-per-share. When a surge is over and there is surplus capacity the blockchain can slowly increase the bandwidth-per-share.

Bandwidth used by an individual user should be measured over a suitably long period of time to allow that user to time-shift their usage. Users tend to login, do many things at once, then logout. This means that their bandwidth over a short period of time may appear much higher than if viewed over a longer period of time. If the time window is stretched too far then the reserve ratio will not adjust fast enough to respond to short-term surges, if the window is too short then clustering usage will have too big of an impact on normal users.

In our estimate it should be sufficient to measure the average weekly bandwidth usage of users. Every time a user signs a transaction, that transaction is factored into their own individual moving average. Any time a user's moving average exceeds the current network limit their transaction is delayed until their average falls below the limit.

### Example Implementation

Let B equal a user's average bandwidth at time T. Let W equal the number of seconds per week, and let N equal the size of the new transaction that occurred S seconds after T. Given this information the blockchain can calculate the new average bandwidth for a user as:

    Bnew = MIN(0,B * (W - S) / W) + N * S / W
    Tnew = T + S
    

Each user is entitled to an average weekly bandwidth of:

    Let U = the user's SP
    Let S = the total number of SP
    Let R = the current reserve ratio between 1 and Rmax
    Let C = the maximum block size capacity set by witnesses
    Let L = the total blocks per week
    Let M = C * L * R
    Allocation = M * U / S
    

A user would be entitled to an average bandwidth of M \* U / S. Any time a transaction would cause the user's average to go above this threshold they would be unable to transact until enough time passes to lower the average.

The network can increase the reserve ratio, anytime blocks are less than half the target capacity and decrease it anytime they are more than half. The algorithm used to adjust R is designed to react quickly to decrease the reserve ratio when there is a surge in demand, while acting slowly to increase the reserve ratio in period of low demand.

The minimum reserve ratio is 1, and the maximum reserve ratio should be calculated to prevent small stakeholders from consuming all of the available bandwidth. If no one is using the available bandwidth then the reserve ratio can grow until a user with just 1 satoshi of the currency is able to transact every single block.

### Case Study: Bitcoin

To understand how this algorithm would work on Bitcoin it is necessary to estimate a reasonable value for the reserve ratio, R, based on actual usage. Based upon the total supply of 15M BTC and a daily transaction volume of 400K BTC[^10], we can derive a minimum reserve ratio of 38 for Bitcoin. Using the equations we can calculate the weekly bandwidth (in bytes) allowed per BTC to be:

    Let C = 1MB = 1024 * 1024
    Let L = 1008 (blocks per week)
    Let R = 38
    Let S = 14000000 BTC (supply minus Satoshi's unmoving coins)
    Let U = 1 BTC
    CLR/S = 2869 bytes per week, or about 5 transactions/week per BTC
    

Since R = 38 is a lower bound on the reserve ratio, CLR/S is a lower bound on the permitted bandwidth. This simple case study suggests a user will require at most 0.20 BTC (over $80 as of this writing) to transact once per week. However, this is a loose upper bound derived from the assumption that all BTC are equally mobile. This is not the case - users with dozens or hundreds of bitcoins do not necessarily transact dozens or hundreds of times a week! The "leftover" transactions that those users "should" have made will increase the reserve ratio, allowing their unused bandwidth to be "recycled" for smaller users.

All of the above estimates are conservative upper bounds assuming coins and usage are distributed in a relatively flat manner. The reality is that heavy users, such as exchanges, have a much higher coin-to-usage ratio than lighter users, which in turn means that actual minimum balance requirements are far lower.

#### Impact of Capacity

Blockchain capacity isn't necessarily capped. It is well within the technological capability of internet infrastructure to increase the Bitcoin block size to 10MB which in turn will reduce the minimum required balance by a factor of 10. While Bitcoin currently supports about 3 transactions per second, alternative implementations are capable of over 1000 transactions per second. This changes our conservative upper bound to 0.0006 BTC or about $0.25, meaning that an account holding $0.25 would be able to transact at least once per week on average (and likely many more times because we're dealing with a fairly loose upper bound).

#### Maximum Number of Unique Users

We can use similar math to calculate the maximum number of unique users that the network can allow to transact once per week as: B\*W/T. T represents the average transaction size. This means Bitcoin could support about 2 million users transacting once per week assuming each user had an equal balance.

#### Comparison to Fees

If we assume a user with $25 dollars worth of BTC transacts once per week and pays a $0.04 cent fee each time then they would pay over $2.00 in fees per year. A user would have to earn a 8% rate of return on their $25 dollars just to break even with paying fees. Chances are that users were going to hold their money on the blockchain anyway, so this user with $25 worth of BTC just saved $2 over the course of a year by adopting a rate-limiting approach rather than a fee-based approach. With just $175 they could transact every single day and save $14 per year.

### Account Creation

Steem's account-based system with publicly known balances simplifies the implementation of the bandwidth-based rate limiting algorithm. Any account with a balance below the minimum required to transact once per week would be unable to transact. This implies that all new accounts should be funded with at least this minimum balance. It also implies that users wishing to transact in smaller amounts can, so long as they hold a larger balance and reuse the account.

It is possible for a low-balance account created during a time of low usage to become inaccessible if the network usage picks up. The funds could be recovered at any time by transferring a larger balance into the account.

In order to maintain a reasonable user experience with a minimum number of hung accounts, all new accounts should start out with a balance 10 times the minimum required to transact weekly. This way even if demand increases by a factor of 10 the account will remain viable.

Any initial account balance would have to come from the user creating the account and not from token creation due to the potential for sybil attacks.

### Justifying Minimum Balances

The concept of forcing users to maintain a minimum balance flows naturally from the value of a user[^11] . Anyone running a business knows that every single user has significant value. Businesses spend anywhere from $30 to $200 to acquire a user. Sometimes they pay users directly, other times they pay for advertizing, and still other times entire companies are bought just for their user base. After a company acquires a user they often given them many *free services* just to keep them around long enough to monetize them through some other means.

Ripple uses a minimum balance[^12] that scales with account resource use and requires that new accounts get funded with at least this minimum balance. Currently this minimum balance is about $0.15 which is greater than the $0.10 we estimated would allow someone to transact freely at least once per week.

A blockchain can enforce a minimum value per user through the simple process of requiring a minimum balance. Any business that wishes to bring a new customer to the blockchain can pre-fund that user's account with the minimum balance that would allow them to transact. Requiring a relatively large fee ($1.00) to sign up new users will naturally force anyone offering free accounts to vet the quality and uniqueness of each account before registering them with the blockchain.

Maintaining a minimum balance is effectively the same as making users pay transaction fees with the interest they could have earned on their balance. The minimum balance is simply the balance required to earn enough interest to pay a fee in a relatively short period of time.

Fortunately, the minimum balance required can be as low as a dollar and this is something users can understand and appreciate. The opportunity cost of lost interest doesn't incur the cognitive cost of a micro-fee and is far more acceptable to users.

The STEEM used to pre-fund an account is Powered Up in the new account (i.e., converted to Steem Power).

### Adjusting the Reserve Ratio

Rate limiting requires that the network adjust the reserve ratio quickly enough to mitigate the impact of an attacker attempting to ood the network. Let's assume the attacker has a large balance, say 1% of the available tokens. If we also assume that the network targets 50% utilization, then a sustained attack should find this user throttled to 25% of network capacity assuming everyone else is also using 25% of the capacity. Stated another way, the largest single user should never be able to consume more than 50% of the target capacity unless they own more than 50% of the SP.

Let's use an initial reserve ratio of 200x. Due to fractional reserves, this means someone holding 1% of the tokens has the right to demand transactions totalling 2x the maximum block size. In order to bring the network usage of the attacker down to 25% the reserve ratio would have to fall to 25x. This would cause the minimum balance required to transact once per week to grow by 8x.

The blockchain can establish a response rate that says any sustained increase in usage should be brought down to the target capacity in within a short period of time (say 30 seconds). An attacker attempting to spam the network shouldn't be able to disrupt service for normal users for more than a minute.

While reductions in the reserve ratio must be quick and non-linear to counter abuse, increases in the reserve ratio should be slow and linear. If the network adjusted in both directions in just 30 seconds then an attacker could pulse the network. A flood of transactions should be corrected in 30 seconds and then take a hour to return to their pre-attack levels. Under this model the attacker could flood the network for 30 seconds per hour or less than 1% of the time.

There must be a slow constant upward pressure on the reserve ratio any time network usage is below 50% until the network hits the maximum reserve ratio. The maximum reserve ratio determines the minimum required stake to flood the network in short bursts.

Any user with fewer than TOTAL\_TOKENS / (2 \* RESERVE\_RATIO) will be unable to produce enough transactions to fill even a single block. With a reserve ratio of 200, this means any user with less than 0.25% of the currency cannot create enough transactions to delay anyone's service.

### Effectiveness Relative to Fees

To compare the effectiveness of rate limiting to fees we must consider how the two systems react to intentional network flooding by an attacker. Under Bitcoin an attacker with $10,000 dollars could disrupt service for an entire day by filling every single block. The same attacker would be unable to disrupt service for even a single block under the dynamic fractional reserve rate limiting approach.

If we go to a more extreme case and assume the attacker holds 1% of all coins then we presume an attacker with $60 million dollars. Such an attacker could deny the Bitcoin blockchain service for 16 years unless the miners increased fees or capacity. Even if fees were raised to $15 per transaction, the attacker could still keep the network flooded for 16 days.

Under the rate limiting approach, someone who holds 1% of all coins with an intent to flood the network would achieve their goal for less than 30 seconds.

### Renting vs. Buying vs. Time Sharing

When someone owns a house they expect the right to use the house for free. If a group of people buy a house together then each can expect the right to use the house proportional to their percentage ownership in the house. A fee based blockchain is like renting the house from its owners, whereas rate limiting is like a timeshare among owners.

If a house is owned by multiple people then those individuals must decide how they wish to timeshare the house. Someone who owns 50% of the house but only uses it one weekend per year might expect to be paid by the individuals who take their unused time. This is the mindset of a fee based system.

On the other hand, someone who owns 50% of the house is speculating that demand for the house will increase in the future and they will be able to sell their stake for more. Any owner who owns more of a house than they use becomes a real estate speculator. With this mindset rather than collecting rent, they collect appreciation.

The value of a share is derived from how much time it can potentially grant its owner. Owning 1% of a house and getting it 1 weekend per year is the lowest value of a share. However, if half of the shareholders never use their weekend, then the value per timeshare rises to 2 weekends per year. If those inactive users instead opt to rent their unused time, then it falls back to 1 weekend per year. If those unused timeshares were sold to people who would use them then the value of a timeshare would fall by 50%. Unless the rent collected is greater than the fall in share value the timeshare owners are making an economic miscalculation.

Using this rationale we can assume that a system based on fees will either be more expensive for its users or be less profitable for its collective owners. An individual small owner may profit by renting out his small time slice, but only at the expense of all other timeshare owners. In effect, the cost of the falling timeshare value is shared among all owners whereas the profits are centralized in the single owner who decided to rent his share.

We can conclude from this that a blockchain is best served by not using usage fees at all. If a usage fee were to be charged as an alternative to rate limiting, then it should be the equivalent of buying enough timeshares and committing to hold them long enough to gain the right use it once.

Stated another way, a transaction fee should be equal to the minimum account balance necessary to transact once per week and it should be refunded at the end of the week. Assume the minimum account balance is $1 and allows someone to transact once per week. If someone with a $1 balance that wishes to perform 5 transactions at once they will have to increase their balance to $5 for a week either before or after their transactions.

In theory a market could form where users can borrow the stake required. In practice it is more efficient for users to simply buy and sell the timeshares necessary to meet their desired usage rate. In other words, the cost of negotiating micro-loans is greater than the cost of maintaining a balance suitable for your maximum weekly usage.

Decentralized rate limiting of transactions can enable new types of decentralized applications that were not viable when every use of the application required a micropayment. This new model gives application developers the ability to decide if and when to charge their users for transactions.

# Performance and Scalability

The Steem network is built upon Graphene, the same technology that powers BitShares. Graphene has been publicly demonstrated sustaining over 1000 transactions per second on a distributed test network. Graphene can easily scale to 10,000 or more transactions per second with relatively straightforward improvements to server capacity and communication protocols.

## Reddit Scale

Steem is capable of handling a larger userbase than Reddit. In 2015 Reddit's 8.7 million users generated an average of 23 comments per second[^13] , with an average of 83 comments per year per user. There were 73 million top-level posts, for an average of 2 new posts per second. There were about 7 billion up votes creating an average voting rate of 220 votes per second. All told, if Reddit were operating on a blockchain it would require an average of 250 transactions per second.

To achieve this industry-leading performance, Steem has borrowed lessons learned from the LMAX Exchange[^14], which is able to process 6 million transactions per second. Among these lessons are the following key points:

1. Keep everything in memory.
2. Keep the core business logic in a single thread.
3. Keep cryptographic operations (hashes and signatures) out of the core business logic.
4. Divide validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks.
5. Use an object oriented data model.

By following these simple rules, Steem is able to process 10,000 transactions per second without any significant effort devoted to optimization.

Keeping everything in memory is increasingly viable given the recent introduction of Optanetechnology from Intel [^15]. It should be possible for commodity hardware to handle all of the business logic associated with Steem in a single thread with all posts kept in memory for rapid indexing. Even Google keeps their index of the entire internet in RAM. The use of blockchain technology makes it trivial to replicate the database to many machines to prevent loss of data. As Optanetechnology takes over, RAM will become even faster while gaining persistence. In other words, Steem is designed for the architectures of the future and is designed to scale.

# Allocation & Supply

The Steem network starts with a currency supply of 0 and allocates STEEM via proof of work at a rate of approximately 40 STEEM per minute to miners, with an additional 40 STEEM per minute being created to seed the content and curation reward pools (for a total of 80 STEEM per minute). Then the network starts rewarding users who convert to SP. At this point, STEEM grows at a rate of approximately 800 STEEM per minute due to the combined effects of the various Contribution Rewards summarized below:

**Contribution Rewards:**

- Curation rewards: 1 STEEM per block or 3.875% per year, whichever is greater
- Content Creation rewards: 1 STEEM per block or 3.875% per year, whichever is greater
- Block production rewards: 1 STEEM per block or 0.750% per year, whichever is greater
- POW inclusion rewards before block 864,000: 1 STEEM per block (awarded as 21 STEEM per round)
- POW inclusion rewards after block 864,000: 0.0476 STEEM per block (awarded as 1 STEEM per round) or 0.750% per year, whichever is greater.
- Liquidity rewards: 1 STEEM per block (awarded as 1200 STEEM per hour) or 0.750% per year, whichever is greater

**Power Rewards:**

- Steem Power rewards: For each STEEM created by the above rewards, 9 STEEM are divided among all Steem Power holders.

**SMD operations:**

- SMD rewards: A percentage of SMD value is created at an APR set by the witnesses and paid to SMD holders as SMD
- Feed Rate following: The amount of STEEM for which the total SMD in existence can be redeemed will change based on changes in the price feed. This change is effectively destruction ("burning") of STEEM when the value of STEEM (as measured by the feed) is increasing, or creation of STEEM when the value of STEEM (as measured by the feed) is declining.

The percentage constraints effectively ensure the incentives for rewards do not become meaninglessly small over time, which is intended to prevent the system from experiencing the "speed bump" in the growth pattern of many other blockchains, where an initial growth spurt fueled by high incentives for early participants is followed by prolonged stagnation as the continually falling incentives drop below the level necessary to induce newcomers to join.

The overall effect of these percentage constants on allocation and supply is that the (approximately) 800 STEEM per minute rate remains in effect for some time (i.e. units of STEEM), but drops in percentage terms (i.e., 800 STEEM is a smaller and smaller fraction of the total supply as the total supply grows larger and larger). When the various individual components of the 800 STEEM per minute rate reach their respective percentage-based floors, each floor halts the fall in its component of the rate. This in turn means that, over the long term, the nominal rate will rise from 800 STEEM per minute to the (time-varying, supply-dependent) value needed to maintain a constant annualized growth rate of 10% for the Contribution Incentives, and a constant annualized growth rate of 100% for the combined effect of the Contribution Incentives and the Power Incentives. The overall effect is a doubling of the STEEM supply each year (but, as detailed in the next section, if most users Power Up then much of this doubling is effectively a "split" which does not transfer ownership).

The overall supply picture is complicated by the effect of SMD operations, which may result in large-scale creation or destruction of STEEM through feed rate following and SMD rewards, as discussed in the SMD section. Other, smaller-scale complicating effects also exist, including unclaimed incentives (e.g. block rewards for missed blocks), noise due to miner luck in proof-of-work production, and the effects of changes in the miner queue length due to a change in the network's total hashpower.

## Impact of Token Creation Rate

At first glance, 100% annual increase in the STEEM supply may appear to be hyper-inflationary and unsustainable. Those who follow the Quantity Theory of Money[^16] may even conclude that the value of STEEM must fall by approximately 5.6% per month. We know from countless real-world examples that the quantity of money does not have a direct and immediate impact on its value, though it certainly plays a role.

Because 90% of all STEEM created is distributed back to holders of SP, the result is similar to having a 2:1 "split" every year rather true inflation. The total rate of expenditures used to reward contributors is about 10% of the market capitalization per year, a rate well below what Bitcoin sustained for the first 7 years after it launched.

Creating new STEEM to pay an incentive to a particular user or group has a negative effect on every other user's balance in terms of their percentage of the STEEM supply. If exactly 90% of the STEEM supply is held in SP, then the negative effect of Contribution Incentives on SP holders' balances is exactly balanced by the positive effect of Power Incentives; SP holders get more STEEM (in nominal terms) but their percentage of the chain (in terms of fraction of the total supply) is unchanged. If less (more) than 90% of the STEEM supply is held as SP, the two effects still point in opposite directions, but the positive (negative) effect becomes greater and the sum of these two effects will tend to pull the SP balance toward 90%. This "pull" does not mean that the SP value must hold at 90% over the long term, because incentive recipients will (and in some cases must) put their STEEM in SP, which means the "pull" towards 90% is not the only force on the percentage of STEEM supply held as SP.

From August 2008 through January 2009 the U.S. money supply[^17] grew from $871B to $1,737B, a rate of over 100% per year and then continued to grow at about 20% per year for the next 6 years. All told the money supply in the U.S. has grown by 4.59x over less than 7 years. During that same time, the value of the dollar relative to goods and services has fallen less than 10% according to the government's price index [^18] . This real-world example demonstrates that supply is only one component of price.

The price of a digital commodity, like STEEM, is driven by both supply and demand. If new STEEM is allocated to those who are holding long-term then the increase in supply is offset by the corresponding demand to hold. The impact of this change in supply is postponed until a future date when the long-term holder decides to sell. The sell pressure is then distributed over 2 years.

When a long-term holder decides to exit, the supply of STEEM on the market will increase and push the price down. This downward pressure is countered when a new long-term holder decides to buy up the STEEM and convert it back into SP. We can therefore conclude that the price will mostly be impacted by a change in demand for holding STEEM long-term.

Of the 100% annual increase in the virtual STEEM supply, 5% of it is in the form of Steem Dollars (SMD). SMD represents a commitment to create a dollar's worth of STEEM in the future and does not impact the amount of STEEM on the market today. The change in debt-to-ownership ratio may impact the perceived value of STEEM, but it does not map directly into a fall in the value of STEEM. If the value of Steem rises over time, then the amount of STEEM that may be created in the future will be less and the corresponding "inflation" never actually happened.

All told the total "spending" Steem does to fund content, curation, mining, and liquidity rewards amounts to just 10% APR or 1.2% per month. The same wealth transfer could be implemented without any change in the STEEM supply by implementing a negative interest rate on liquid STEEM of around 10% per month. Stated another way, it could be implemented by charging a 3% fee (similar to credit cards) on every transfer and having 1% of all STEEM transferred every single day. The Bitcoin network transfers[^19] 400,000 BTC out of 15.5M (or 2.5% daily).

The purpose of liquid STEEM is to facilitate changes in ownership between long-term holders. It is this change in ownership that the network "taxes" to fund growth. This transfer tax can be avoided almost completely by automatically selling STEEM for SMD every week as the network converts SP back to STEEM. The total time spent holding STEEM will be so small that any impact of changing STEEM supply will be insigni cant next to volatility and other market fees.

### Impact of Token Creation Rate Greater than Ninety-Percent

As of May 1, 2016, over 98.49% of all STEEM has been converted to SP. This demonstrates that demand to hold long term dominates. In this environment both liquid STEEM and SP are diluted to fund rewards.

For the first 2 years of Bitcoin's life the network sustained an annual inflation rate[^20] of over 100%. For the first 5 years it was over 30%, and for the first 8 years it was over 10%. According to the tool for estimating future inflation included with the Steem source code, Steem by contrast will achieve an instantaneous annual rate of approximately 12% after just 1 year (not including the effects of SMD operations).

### Accounting In Steem

The increase in the supply of STEEM is mostly an accounting artifact created by the desire to avoid charging negative interest rates on liquid STEEM. Negative interest rates would complicate the lives of exchanges which would have to adjust user balances to account for the negative rate of return of STEEM held on deposit. Mirroring the blockchain logic exactly would be error prone and complicate integration and adoption. Therefore, STEEM has chosen to never charge someone's account, but instead to increase supply. This achieves a similar economic result without forcing everyone accepting STEEM deposits to implement negative interest rates on their internal ledger.

A side effect of increasing the supply is that the network will require ever increasing levels of precision in its accounting. On average the number of bits required to represent a typical account will grow by 1.3 per year. It will only take 10 years before numbers involved no longer fit within the 53 bit precision supported by JavaScript or the 64 bit precision supported by CPUs. Over time the magnitude of the numbers involved grows beyond human scale and comprehension; furthermore, the least significant bits have so little economic value as to render them meaningless.

In order to compensate for the ever increasing precision, the STEEM network performs a 10:1 "reverse split" every 32,000,000 blocks (about 3 years). At this point in time all balances of STEEM are divided by 10 and all prices are multiplied by 10. Cryptocurrency exchanges will have to suspend trading around this time and update the account balances and price history to reflect the "reverse split" before resuming trading.

All rounding errors will be in favor of the network. Every balance may lose up to 0.009 STEEM due to rounding, but this amount of STEEM should be economically insignificant. Collectively all holders of SP will lose at most 0.009 STEEM.

# The Power of Steem

Steem recognizes that the value of all user contributions (posts and votes) is greater than the sum of the parts. A single comment is worth next to nothing, but millions of curated posts is worth many millions (or possibly even billions) of dollars. A single vote provides little curation value, but billions of votes is very effective curation. Content without curation is of limited value. Given all the content of the Internet minus the links between it, Google would struggle to produce useful search results. It is the links between information that give it significant value.

Because everyone benefits, everyone should pay. In other words, no individual user should be expected to pay for anything, but instead should be paid for everything they do that brings value to Steem. All we need to do is ascertain which user contributions bring a social network value and which ones don't.

Collectively Reddit users vote 220 times per second and make 23 posts per second. Reddit is valued between $500 million[^21] and $4 billion[^22] which means that each and every upvote and post is worth between $0.06 and $0.50 assuming the value of Reddit is mostly within the past year's worth of activity. One could argue that most of the value of Reddit is the near-real-time discussions that have occurred within the past week which would dramatically increase the value of new activity. People go where people are today, not where people were last year.

## No Micropayments, Tips Optional

Existing attempts at integrating a cryptocurrency into a social media platform have focused on enabling users to pay one another. Many services have attempted to introduce tipping. The theory is that if we make tipping simple enough then more people will do it. Other services attempt to get people to pay to promote or boost their content's ranking. Still others attempt to build small prediction markets on how many tips an article will receive.

All of these approaches boil down to micropayments. They differ only in who is making the payment. They all suffer from insufficient engagement of people making the micropayments. In the search for incentivised content production entrepreneurs have been so focused on who should pay that they missed the obvious reality: everyone benefits from everyone's actions so everyone should pay or no one should pay, depending on how you look at it.

Steem bypasses micropayments completely because when a user upvotes a post it is the community that pays the bill. The same amount of money will be spent whether the user upvotes a post or not and the funds will not come from the voter.

The mental energy associated with making an economic decision becomes a barrier to participation for most people.

> *We already face a multitude of choices everyday with regards to what to access online in this digital era of the information explosion, and every additional decision that we must make simply adds on to the uncertainty and anxiety we face. Micropayment supporters believe that a simplified implementation can minimize the intrusiveness of micropayments and improve user experience, but their argument only creates double standards for the decision making process \[2\]. A transaction cannot simultaneously be worth enough to warrant a decision and worth so little that the decision is automatic. **The only transactions that users can approve without thought are ones that cost them nothing**, thus any micro-transaction of positive value will incur mental costs through its requiring a decision. Furthermore, mental transaction costs actually rise below a certain threshold value, a phenomenon that places micropayments at an even greater disadvantage. For instance, it is easy to think that a copy of today's newspapers costs $1, but readers face much more difficulty and anxiety in deciding on the value of each article or word. Such a dilemma will only be replicated and exacerbated if all online content were to be broken down into their components and individually valued within a micropayment system.*

> *- Micropayments: A Viable Business Model [^23]*

Under Steem, micropayments are paid to content producer, but those who vote for the content do not pay. Instead, the cost of the reward is paid for via new tokens. Someone can join the system, vote to pay someone, and then exit the system with more money than they started with (assuming the market valuation of the Steem system remained constant). In other words, the micropayment solution provided by Steem provides a user-experience similar to many widely used websites that have user-moderated content.

Furthemore, Steem pays people to figure out who should be paid! This kind of thinking is revolutionary.

## Value is in the Links

The Internet would lose the vast majority of its value if all links among content were removed. It is the relationship among web pages that allows Google to identify the best apple pie recipe among the 16 million results. Without the links the only information Google would have is word frequency.

Links can take many forms and have adapted over time. Every time a user votes on content in a social network they add a link between themselves and the content. This in turn links the consumer to the producer through the content. The more links a network has the more valuable the information becomes. It is the relative and intentional connectedness of information that gives it value.

A social network can maximize the value extracted from a set of content by maximizing the quantity and quality of links. Curating content is expensive and time consuming while being near impossible for computers to perform in the absence of links. Steem rewards users who are among the first to find and link to new content.

By incentivising curation the Steem network is able to use automated algorithms to extract the most valuable information from a massive amount of content.

## Solving the Cryptocurrency Onboarding Problem

It isn't easy to get into cryptocurrency[^24] . Someone who discovers Bitcoin and wants to try it out quickly learns that they will need to sign up with an exchange and fund their account with a credit card or wire transfer. What would Facebook's adoption rate have been like if you had to fork over money and a two forms of ID?

Steem solves this problem by giving everyone a way to get paid for doing simple, but valuable, tasks. This will help to widely distribute STEEM tokens. This is helpful because cryptocurrencies have a network effect (i.e. more users make it more useful; for an extreme example, consider that if Satoshi had kept 100% of Bitcoin for himself, Bitcoin would be worthless).

## Solving the Cryptocurrency Liquidation Problem

A currency that is difficult to use or impossible to sell has little value. Someone who comes across $1.00 worth of Bitcoin will discover that it costs more than $1.00 to sell that Bitcoin. They have to create an account with an exchange, perform KYC validation, and pay fees. Small amounts of cryptocurrency are like small change that people are unwilling to bend over to pick up.

Merchants give users a way to quickly convert their cryptocurrency into tangible goods and services. Merchants need a currency pegged to their unit of account, normally dollars. Accepting a volatile currency introduces significant accounting overhead.

Merchants will accept any currency if it increases their sales. Having a large user base with a stable currency such as SMD lowers the barrier to entry for merchants. The presence of merchants improves the system by creating an off-ramp for users to exit the system without going to the trouble of using an exchange.

Another way that people can liquidate the small amounts of cryptocurrency they receive from participating on the Steem platform is through tipping others. This is like leaving the small change as a tip for your waiter. When enough people leave small tips it adds up to a meaningful amount. You and the waiter each gain a benefit from the tip.

## Censorship

Steem is a decentralized network that is operated by miners in jurisdictions around the world. All user actions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, and can be publicly verified. This means that there is no single entity that can censor content that is valued by STEEM holders.

Individual websites such as steemit.com may censor content on their particular site, but content published on the blockchain is inherently broadcast traffic and mirrors all around the world may continue to make it available.

Freedom of speech is the foundation of all other liberties and any infringement upon freedom of speech undermines the only peaceful means of reaching consensus: discussion. Without free discussion voters cannot be fully informed, and uninformed voters are a greater threat to society than losing the right to vote. Censorship is a means of stealing votes through limiting public discourse. Steem is committed to enabling free speech and building a free society.

## Solving Organic Discovery via Search Engine Optimization

Most cryptocurrencies generate little value for those who are not actively using the network. Steem, by contrast, generates content and encourages users to share it. This content gets indexed by search engines and ultimately will bring value to a large number of passive users. This search traffic creates organic advertising for the Steem network and grows the network effect.

## Shifting Toward Blockchain-based Attribution

The internet represents the easiest medium for distributing information in the world. With that said, it can be a frightening place for content creators who would like to own their content and have it shared with proper attribution. On current social media platforms, attribution is something that can be lost overnight - a posted video or image can be replicated and re-shared without consent or regard for the creator.

Under blockchain-based social media, a creator or author would always be able to point to a public record and timestamp showing proof of their content origination. In a circumstance where a creator would like to address those who have re-shared without permission or attribution, blockchain-based records provide public proof that the content was posted by a particular user at a particular time. In the future, blockchain-based attribution could come to be recognized by governments for its authenticity and could hold weight in court, which would give content creators greater powers to control their work.

While a timestamping service can be built on almost any blockchain, and several efforts exist to build this kind of service on the Bitcoin network, Steem has a useful advantage in this realm because content publishers are "first class citizens" - the Steem blockchain is built from the ground up around the use case of content publication, which allows content creators to have the blockchain to validate their content at a certain point in time simply by writing their post using the same authoring tools used by other Steem users.

## Replacing Advertising with Blockchain-based Content Rewards

Under most content monetization models, content creators leverage advertising in one form or another. Many creators recognize how advertising may diminish their work's value to the consumer, yet creators very often must seek returns on their time by monetizing. Advertising represents a double-edged sword: With ads, a creator can make money most easily. Without ads, monetization is difficult but the content is richer.

Creators posting to social media outlets that are connected to Steem may monetize merely by having their work recognized (or "liked") by the Steem community. Blockchain-based payouts are completely digital and have no middle-man. Therefore monetization by blockchain-based content rewards should be faster and much lower barrier to use than monetization by advertisements.

# Conclusion

Steem is an experiment designed to address challenges in the cryptocurrency and social media industries by combining the best aspects from both. Steem presents earning opportunities to content creators and internet readers in ways that have not existed within the social media industry. Within Steem, individuals earn real rewards online that are directly correlated to their contributions. Those rewards will have dollar value due to the market price discovery and liquidity of Steem, and the people who hold Steem will have more exclusive earning powers than those who do not.
